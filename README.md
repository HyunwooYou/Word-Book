# Word-Book
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Spring Boot

* Ruby on Rails

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

We developed the server and client parts using different frameworks. Social-Scheduler is a server and Social-Sheduler-Client is a client. The part I developed is the server part.
